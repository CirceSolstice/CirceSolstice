Greetings and Salutations

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few little projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Bash scripting
- âš¡ Fun fact: When you keep adding the digits of each perfect square together until you have only one digit...
     the remaingin digits form a pattern: (1,4,9,7,7,9,4,1...)
